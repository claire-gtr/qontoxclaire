ASSIGNMENT 2

The SEO manager has this need: he wrote an article with a big infographic
and he told you: “I would like to improve the user experience here! When a
visitor clicks on the infographic, I want to give him the possibility to zoom”.

What are your first actions to move forward with this need?

1/ Ask more details about the feature

- Can you please give me some more details ?
  - As soon as he clicks the infographics needs to get bigger ? Or do we need to add a button and offer the possibiity to zoom or not ?
  - The zoom has to be implemented with a scroll wheel or plus and minus buttons ?

- What's going to be the "unzoom" scenario ? 
  - When the user clicks out of the infographic the zoom goes away ?

- How urgent is that feature ?


2/ Try to find a different ways to implement this and ask my colleagues for their opinion during a team meeting


3/ Propose and agree on a solution that suits the need of the SEO manager

- We could make the infographic smoothly bigger on hover, what do you think ?

- I think the scroll wheel is easier to use than the plus and minus buttons, 
what do you think ?

- Solution is found after brainstorming

4/ Get a design validated for this solution


4/ Create a detailed card for this new feature

- Explain who asked for this new feature

- Give details on the whole flow (zooming and unzooming)

- Give this task a planned date (is it urgent or not?)

- Give this task a complexity rate (how much time do I think I am going to spend on this)
